Explanations:

OSC A SYNC connects to OSC B SAW through a switch on the front panel 
- NB: C3 is facing in the oposite direction of the part next to it


Possible modifications:

If you don't want the leveled output from osc 1 triangle wave, do the following:

Do not mount IC3. Instead, connect a 100k resistor from pin 1 to pin 3 where the IC would have been. Then, instead of R338, insert a 
560k resistor. Finally, instead of R337, put a jumper wire. The circuit now matches that of osc 2.
